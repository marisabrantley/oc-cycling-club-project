# Orange County Cycling Club Project

This single-page website was the Challenge Project for Codecademy Pro's "Learn Responsive Design" class. I enjoy cycling and was inspired by a local cycling Meetup group.

## Objective

Build a responsive webpage for a real or fictitious local club.

*Demonstrate:*

* Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size.
* Using a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
* Employing responsive units em and rem to size and space elements with width and padding.

I also encorporated Flexbox in this project.
